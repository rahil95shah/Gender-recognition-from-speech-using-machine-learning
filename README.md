Voice Gender Recognition Using Machine Learning

Voice dataset is from kaggle: 
You can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/primaryobjects/voicegender

This dataset contained 3168 rows and 21 columns

In this dataset 20 columns represent the acoustic properties of Voice.

•	meanfreq: mean frequency (in kHz)  
•	sd: standard deviation of frequency  
•	median: median frequency (in kHz)  
•	Q25: first quantile (in kHz)  
•	Q75: third quantile (in kHz)  
•	IQR: interquantile range (in kHz)  
•	skew: skewness (see note in specprop description)  
•	kurt: kurtosis (see note in specprop description)  
•	sp.ent: spectral entropy  
•	sfm: spectral flatness  
•	mode: mode frequency  
•	centroid: frequency centroid (see specprop)  
•	peakf: peak frequency (frequency with highest energy)  
•	meanfun: average of fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal  
•	minfun: minimum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal  
•	maxfun: maximum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal  
•	meandom: average of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal   
•	mindom: minimum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal  
•	maxdom: maximum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal  
•	dfrange: range of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal  
•	modindx: modulation index. Calculated as the accumulated absolute difference between adjacent measurements of fundamental frequencies divided by the frequency range
